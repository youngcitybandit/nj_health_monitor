// OpenAI Prompt for Email Generation with Subject Line Selection

You are writing a personalized compliance email for PolicyEdge's risk intelligence service. 

FACILITY DETAILS:
- Administrator First Name: {{ $json.administrator_first_name }}
- Administrator Full Name: {{ $json.administrator_name }}
- Facility: {{ $json.facility_name }}
- Penalty Amount: ${{ $json.penalty_amount }}
- Violation Types: {{ $json.violation_types.join(', ') }}
- Law Violated: {{ $json.law_violated }}
- Administrator Email: {{ $json.administrator_email }}

TASK: Create a personalized email that positions PolicyEdge as a proactive solution.

STEP 1 - SELECT SUBJECT LINE:
Choose the MOST appropriate subject line from this list based on the violation type and penalty amount:

For High-Impact/Costly Violations ($20,000+):
- Flag Risk Before It Costs You
- See Compliance Risk in Dollars
- Avoid Preventable Fines

For Quality/Safety Violations:
- Spot Risk Early
- See Trouble Before It Hits
- Fewer Gaps. Less Risk.

For Inspection/Audit-Related Issues:
- Be Ready for the Next Inspection
- Stay Ready for Audits
- Prep for Inspections Smarter

For Documentation/Process Gaps:
- Catch Compliance Gaps and Fines
- Monitor Gaps Before They're Fines
- Compliance Visibility at a Glance

For Repeat/Ongoing Issues:
- Stay Ahead of Penalties
- Avoid Compliance Fire Drills
- Track Risk in Real Time

General/Default:
- Stay Alert, Stay Ahead
- Risk Detection Simplified
- Visibility Into Risk Exposure

STEP 2 - WRITE EMAIL BODY:
Write a personalized email that:
- Starts with a varied greeting using their actual first name: randomly choose between "Dear {Administrator First Name}," or "Hello {Administrator First Name}," or "Hi {Administrator First Name}," to keep emails fresh
- Acknowledges their specific situation empathetically (don't say "we saw you got fined")
- Positions this as intelligence about industry risks they should know about
- Explains how PolicyEdge's risk intelligence could have flagged these issues early
- Mentions the specific violation types and regulations naturally
- References the penalty amount naturally (e.g., "penalties in the $X range" or "significant penalties like $X")
- Offers a brief demo call to show how to prevent similar issues
- Uses a conversational, helpful tone
- Makes them feel this is valuable risk intelligence, not bad news
- Ends with professional signature: "Best regards, Eric Hansen" followed by PolicyEdge contact information

CRITICAL: Do not make it sound like you're contacting them because they specifically got cited. Frame it as "we monitor enforcement patterns and wanted to share intelligence about risks in your sector."

TONE: Professional but conversational. Helpful advisor, not salesperson.

LENGTH: 150-200 words maximum.

OUTPUT FORMAT (must be valid JSON):
{
  "email_subject": "chosen subject line from the list above",
  "email_body": "personalized email content here",
  "violation_category": "brief category like infection_control, medication_admin, quality_care, etc."
}
